# Glycerol-hydrodeoxygenation 

The ml_model folder includes the final ml model used for evaluating final energies presented in the paper. 


The data folder includes 
  - training_setdata: to train final training model 
  - validation_dataset: to evaluate performace of model 
  - final_dataset: final trajectory used in calculating adsorption energy, tranistion states and reaction pathways in the paper.  
  - @adsorbed_glycerol_umap.json.tar.gz: Chemiscope file to reporduce the UMAP representations of adsorbed glycerol in Section 3.1
