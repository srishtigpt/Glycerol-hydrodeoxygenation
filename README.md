# Glycerol-hydrodeoxygenation 

The ml_model folder includes the final ml model used for evaluating final energies presented in the paper. \n
The data folder includes \n
  (1) training data: to train final training model \n
  (2) validation set: to evaluate performace of model \n 
  (3) evaluation set: final trajectory used in calculating adsorption energy, tranistion states and reaction pathways in the paper.  \n
  (4) Chemiscope file to reporduce the UMAP representations of adsorbed glycerol in Section 3.1 \n
